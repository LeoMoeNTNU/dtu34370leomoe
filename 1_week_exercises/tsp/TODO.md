# What would be cool:

## modularization

## implement chirstofides-stuff. 
### includes MST first. 

## good randomized testing, both for different problem sizes. 

## swap function could be faster because we shouldnt check the whole thing to see if we should check


## verification that the algorithms actually do what they should.
