I am writing some code for my course to test some of the concepts myself. 

One of the teachers argued that an algorithm is useless if you cant implement it and that seems reasonable to me. 

For now there is only some code in 1_week_exercises. It compiles with "gcc NN.c -lm"
I may modularize a bit, in which case I will also have a shell file for interacting with it.
